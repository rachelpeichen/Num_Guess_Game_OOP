## Java programming labs (Basic)
These labs are my assignments for [Information System Training Porgram](https://train.csie.ntu.edu.tw/train/) lectured by Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering at National Taiwan University. 

It's a course suitable for beginners without any programming experience, and also for high school students who want to take APCS exam.

This lecture covers more than 90% of the contents in [Barron's book](https://www.amazon.com/AP-Computer-Science-Practice-Barrons/dp/1438012896).

Before joining this class, I have no knowledge of Java. But after I finished it, I gained the basic concept of Java and started to further self-learning advanced Java.
